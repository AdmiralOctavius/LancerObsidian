## Core System
#### Xiong-Type CQB Suite
Surviving mostly on colonial rations and an increasingly radioactive air supply, Xiaoli scavenged materials from a dying ship to create modifications that gave her mech unprecedented unarmed striking power.
#### Passive - Xiaoli's Tenacity
1/turn as a free action, you may move up to 3 spaces then deal 2 Kinetic to any adjacent character or 10 Kinetic AP to an object or piece of terrain. This movement prompts engagement and does not ignore reactions.
If this damage destroys an object or piece of terrain, it explodes, dealing 1d6 Kinetic to all adjacent characters other than you and knocking them back 1 space.

#### Active - Xiaoli's Ingenuity
For the rest of the scene, this system gains 6 charges (you can use a die to track this). Expend a charge to use XIAOLI’S TENACITY again, ignoring the 1/Turn limit. You may spend any number of charges a turn. At the end of each turn, you regain a charge for each unique target (character, object, or piece of terrain) you damaged with this action, to a maximum of 6.
