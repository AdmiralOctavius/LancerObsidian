Templates can also be used to decide the difficulty
level of a battle. A battle of standard difficulty could
include any combination of the following:
- One or two NPCs without templates per player.
- Three to four Grunts per player.
- One Elite per one to two players.
- One Ultra per 4 players.

You can use these opponents in various combinations. 
For example, if you have four players, you could
mix in four grunts and three NPCs without templates.
These enemies should be of an appropriate tier for
the PCs.

You can make a fight easier by reducing the number
of enemies or lowering their tier, and you can make
fights hard by increasing their tier, or by adding more
enemies, elite enemies, enemies with optional systems, 
or enemies with extra templates.
The perfect approach to combat balance is something
you will need to figure out with your players. There are
no rigid guidelines here, because actual difficulty will
depend on the needs and builds of your specific group.

**Donâ€™t take the above advice as a rigid set of rules**,
but instead as a starting point or guide. Every group is
going to want a different level of challenge
