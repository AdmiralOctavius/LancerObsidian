Name: Tiger Praetorian

Background: "something something thought old sentai and gundam shows and media was detailing real life heroes and mech pilots"

Notes: Watched old earth vault media of sentai shows and gundam stuff, thinks that those were real heroes and strives to be like them. Believes the hype s much that they actually pull it off, people are either too charmed, or just don't have the heart to tell them its not real, because they have cemented themselves as a local legend.
