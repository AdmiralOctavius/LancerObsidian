Helga, the primary planet of the Thorunn System
Part of the new frontier for UNION.
Was in the process of becoming integrated with UNION some 40-50 years ago local time. A civil war resulting in [[Vlasi Aminov]] rising to power and becoming an Absolute Rule King. Utilizing "dark magics" and an abundance of pre-UNION tech to consolidate power.

[[Vlasi Aminov]]'s sister, [[Devora Aminov]] is one of the few who has the influence to move the people to overthrow [[Vlasi Aminov|Vlasi]] and gain enough control to move to UNION status.

Within the bounds of [[Vlasi Aminov]]'s sprawling kingdom, lies the "suffocating wastes (temp name)". Dominated by a massive crater that radiates fear, danger, and actual reactivity. Not to mention the bounds of reality breaking down.
In truth the wastes contain a METAVAULT, a pre-UNION, old-Earth cache of # anomalous material. If opened, the contents could doom the world, or allow he who owns the vault to rule this sector of space.

Elsewhere within the kingdom, is the fertile bay, that compromises the seat of [[Vlasi Aminov]]'s power. A rich farmland that has the capital at its center, a massive city-capital that has been dominated by [[Vlasi Aminov|Vlasi]].

Within the lands in neutral territory, is the "verdant sanctuary (name pending)"
A hidden city within the peaks of one of Helga's mountain ranges. [[Kenji Hasegawa]] is the head of the hidden city and its not insignificant defenses.

The central hub of UNIONs support of the rebellion groups/unifed powerrs against Vlasi is in [[Emberg City]]. A spraling mega city that serves as one of the planet's only major spaceports, making it a vital asset to hold in the ongoing war. Losing the city could leave any Mercenary or UNION assets stranded.
