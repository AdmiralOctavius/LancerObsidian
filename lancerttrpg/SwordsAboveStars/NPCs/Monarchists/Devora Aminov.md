Member of the monarchist army
Pilot of the squad that was taken down in Episode: [[Miles to Go]]

Notes:
- Has key intel regarding the approach to next key objective.
	- Specifically what spaces the Monarchists know the research facility is not in.
- Has rumor level intel regarding the more advanced gear that the Monarchist army is using. 
	- "I've heard about what's been being developed back in the capital. The mech frames, the weapons they're firing, they look unnatural."

Trained in anti-interrogation techniques, but will succumb to excessive posturing.
Not a true believer in the Monarchist cause, was just a job for them.
