Summary: knight adept from the Albatross clans, setting out to become their own legacy.
Name: Emma Round
Callsign: 

Hailing from the Albatross, the long-lived space knights. Joined them from a relatively young age, she heard the myths of King Arthur from one of the oldest knights there, probably didnâ€™t actually see the correct myths or at least what did survive after earth, but enough that she got the code of chivalry and the idea of being a mythic knight of the round table in her head.
