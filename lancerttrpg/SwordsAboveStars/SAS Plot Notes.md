Our story here on the planet of [[Helga]] specifically, revolves around the members of the [[Inconnu Mercenary Company]]. [[WASTE]], [[Lancelot]], and [[Scope]].

Some 70-80 years ago realspace time, [[Vlasi Aminov]] and [[Devora Aminov]] were born in the [[crater-wastes]] of the northern continent. The crater-wastes is a massive bowl/valley of territory, spanning nearly a hundred kilometers and having a depth of nearly 10km. Partially irradiated, the [[crater-wastes]] are a no-mans land of biological?? monsters and tech of ages past. buried in the rock, goo, and woods are some of the remnants of [[Helga]]'s first megacity, now a decimated ruin beneath the earth.

At the center of the [[crater-wastes]] lies the towering ruins known as [[The Pillar of Metal]] a monolith of stone and metal fused into a monument at the crater's center. Barely anyone in the modern era knows what lies inside the Pillar. Except for [[Vlasi Aminov|Vlasi]] and [[Devora Aminov|Devora]]. In their youth they ventured together from their caravan, finding a path into the Pillar and peering into the horrors within.

Consequently, they were both *touched* by the MetaVault that was contained within the Pillar's structure. Driven to brief madness, the two fled. Eventually [[Vlasi Aminov]] became afflicted by delusions of grandur and began to assemble a cult of personality from those in the wastes.

[[Devora Aminov]] attempted to curtail her brother's campaign of conquest, but was also lost in her own throes of madness. Their initial conflict led to the deaths of their home, the caravan that had raised them. Fearing for her live [[Devora Aminov|Devora]] fled the [[crater-wastes]] and journeyed across [[Helga]] to find peace.

[[Vlasi Aminov]]'s rise to power was swift, total, and terrifying.  [[Helga]] had been on the brink of being accepted into UNION's onboarding programs before the city of [[Ladiza]] was captured by [[Vlasi Aminov|Vlasi]]'s army. A combination of strangely modified mecha frames as well as backing from off planet backers let a proper civil war kick off before UNION could respond.

In the years following the rise of [[Vlasi Aminov|Vlasi]]'s monarchy, multiple rebellion groups have coalesced into a united front, attempting to retake [[Ladiza]] and free [[Helga]] from Old World ideals.

[[Devora Aminov]], after fleeing from the [[crater-wastes]], eventually found her way to a veritable garden of eden within the mountains. There she spent her time amassing a following and learning to manage the effects of being *touched*. 
Here in the garden city that she's built, the scientific enclave that she's created could be the key to ending the war, considering she's one of very few who know the way to the [[The Pillar of Metal]], and thus the center of [[Vlasi Aminov]]'s power

UNION's lackluster response time can be attributed to getting the New Divide to shift missions and bring [[Helga]] into the focus of their operations. after nearly 20 years of fighting alongside the Rebellion, the New Divide is calling in further and further mercenary resources to end the conflict once and for all.

In the background, much of the original government that had attempted to join UNION collapsed under the weight of the Civil war, with most of the planet fracturing into City-States with large stretches of unclaimed/unmanaged territory thanks to the chaos of the conflict. 

[[Ladiza]] had been one of 2 primary spaceports that had completed construction before the civil war began in earnest. [[Emberg City]] is the other city that has a functional spaceport, being the only port of call for any larger vessel attempting to land planetside.

With the conflict in full swing, air superiority is rarely assured, and transport of materials by air or sea is almost guaranteed to attract the attention of the Monarchy. With logistics being dominated by rail or by road, combat lines end up being defined by who can remain supplied.

Orbital tier cannons around both [[Ladiza]] and [[Emberg City]] have led to neither faction being able to make decisive alpha strikes against one another during the war.
