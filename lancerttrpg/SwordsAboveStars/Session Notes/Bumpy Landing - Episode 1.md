## Strong Start

Space, an infinite expanse, and a place of infinite conflict. Struggles for survival or glory happen constantly in a galaxy that is still moving, still developing, still growing. 
UNION, despite its long, storied history, has so much farther to go to bring the 3 Pillars and *hope* to all of humankind. And on the edge of that growing hope, begins our story.

Located in the Sierra Madre ring, just galactic north of GasherBrum, lies the star system of Thorunn. It's primary planet, [[Helga]], has been in conflict for decades. Over a half century ago UNION had begun the process of integrating the system into the Core Worlds system. Talks fell through when a monarchistic faction took control of one of the planet's major spaceports, starting a planetwide campaign of conquest overnight.

Today, [[Helga]] independent forces and rebels work the The New Divide to unseat [[Vlasi Aminov]] and bring an end to the old ways on [[Helga]].

Our Camera shifts into orbit around [[Helga]]. There we find the flagship of the [[Inconnu Mercenary Company]].
Onboard the starship, we find you, in the main briefing room of the IMC-FireFinch. Your Captain [[Leighton Thomas]] giving you a briefing about the current assignment.
