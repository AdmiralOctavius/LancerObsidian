Right after the [[Forest Foraging]] mission the members are escorted into the [[Advanced Quantum Laser Research Facility]] or AQLRF. The facility is a sprawling underground complex, with the research lab right at the center. 

The team meets [[Cason Wise]] who introduces them to the facility heads.
